# TRTLLM sleep/wake semantics (differs from vLLM/SGLang):
# - Weights are published once to GMS as a committed layout (shared via weights server).
# - KV cache is managed entirely by TRTLLM's own VMM — no kv_cache GMS server needed.
# - Sleep: KV cache is freed via collective RPC or local VMM tagged ops (GPU memory drops),
#   while weights remain committed in GMS (unmap VAs + abort from weights server).
# - Wake: weights reconnect as RO to the same committed layout, then KV cache is
#   recreated in a fresh local VMM region.
